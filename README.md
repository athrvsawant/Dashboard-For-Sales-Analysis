# Dashboard-For-Sales-Analysis
 Power BI dashboard for sales analysis at Atliq Technologies!

To gather the required data, I used my SQL knowledge to query the database. Then, I applied Power Query to clean and transform the data as part of the ETL process. 

Some key learnings from this project:
ðŸ“Œ Power Query is an effective tool for data cleaning and ETL operations.
ðŸ“Œ DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) proved useful for creating new measures and calculated columns based on specific business requirements.
